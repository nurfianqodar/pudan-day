          Happy birthday, Diva Tari Asina Munthe
        </h1>
        <p>
          Hey resilient woman, on your special day, I'm sorry I couldn't get you
          anything. All I have are my best wishes for you.
        </p>
        <p>I hope your birthday is meaningful and filled with joy.</p>
        <p>
          On your 20th birthday, I wish you become as strong and resilient as
          our mother.
        </p>
        <p>
          May you grow into a woman everyone can be proud of — for your father,
          your mother, your siblings, and for me too.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the challenges you've conquered, let them shape you into a person
          as strong as a diamond.
        </p>
        <p>Here's to making you "boru ni raja."</p>
        <p>Happy birthday, dear❤️</p>
